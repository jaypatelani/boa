Write this peice of code in your favourite text writer as exactly as showd below. save file as "Dice.adb" then run "gnatmake Dice.adb" at your
terminal/command prompt to create executable file.Now you should be able to see "Dice" file which you can execute from terminal with "./Dice" Magic if
everything worked smooth you should be able to see random dice number.

CODE:
with ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
with ada.numerics.discrete_random;

procedure Dice is
   type DiceRange is new Integer range 1..6;
   package DiceRand_Int is new ada.numerics.discrete_random(DiceRange);
   use DiceRand_Int;
   gen : Generator;
   num : DiceRange;
begin
   reset(gen);
   num := random(gen);
   put_line(DiceRange'Image(num));
end Dice;
